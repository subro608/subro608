### Hi there, I'm Subhrajit Dey! ðŸ‘‹
![Waving Hand](https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif)

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, specializing in computer vision, machine learning, and the exciting realm of Large Language Models (LLMs). Previously, I worked as a Computer Vision Engineer at BigVision.ai, engaging deeply in human pose estimation, image/video understanding, and 3D vision.

ðŸŒ± My academic and professional journey is committed to exploring and harnessing the transformative capabilities of AI technologies, including LLMs, to develop innovative solutions for digital and physical environments. I'm particularly fascinated by the potential of computer vision and LLMs to revolutionize industries and improve human-computer interaction.

ðŸ’¬ I am actively seeking collaborative opportunities in research and projects that advance the frontiers of artificial intelligence, focusing on real-world applications and theoretical advancements.
