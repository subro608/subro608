# Hi there, I'm Subhrajit Dey! üëã

## About Me
üî≠ I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, specializing in computer vision, machine learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs).
- GPA: 4.0 (First Semester)
- Courses: Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Machine Learning, and Software Engineering

üéì B.E (Hons.) in Electrical Engineering from Jadavpur University
- GPA: 8.78/10.0

üß† Previously, I worked as a Computer Vision Engineer at BigVision.ai (June 2022 - June 2024), where I:
- Developed people and vehicle detection systems using YOLOv5n with state-of-the-art F1-scores on infrared video datasets
- Enhanced YOLOv5 models with Alarm-based and Kalman filter-based tracking for precise object tracking
- Optimized video encoding/decoding pipelines using OpenVINO, FFmpeg, and OpenCV
- Cut OpenAI API costs 20x by shifting from GPT-4 to GPT-3.5 with advanced prompt engineering

üåü Also served as a Mitacs Globalink Research Intern at √âTS Montreal (June 2021 - Sept 2021):
- Developed 360StereoNet, the first model to generate depth maps from 360-degree stereoscopic images

üå± My academic and professional journey is committed to exploring and harnessing the transformative capabilities of AI technologies to develop innovative solutions for both digital and physical environments.

üí¨ I'm actively seeking collaborative opportunities in research and projects that advance the frontiers of artificial intelligence, with a focus on real-world applications and theoretical advancements.
